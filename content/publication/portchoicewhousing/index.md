abstract = "I find that the stock market participation puzzle is largely explained by homeownership, high exit rates among stock market participants, and per-period participation costs. Panel data reveal that 20% of participating US households exit over two years, and that exit is associated with changes in homeownership. I solve a life-cycle portfolio choice model  with per-period stock market participation costs and a rent/own house tenure decision. The combination of per-period costs and housing means that 'house poor households with high leverage prefer to build home equity instead of saving in stocks and this explains the low participation rate among the middle-aged. Further, the transition from renting to owning increase the probability of exit, explaining the low participation and high exit rate of young households. The estimated model jointly matches the participation rate, homeownership rate, net worth and conditional portfolio weights over the life cycle. Housing reduces the unexplained participation gap between the model and the data by 75%, compared to a model without housing."
abstract_short = "Homeownership and Stock Market Participation are tightly connected. Changes in house tenure induce stock market exit, which explains the low stock market participation rate among US households"
